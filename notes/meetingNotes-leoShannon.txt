* 1
   * Plants stressed, not recovering with return of moisture. 
   * Can we compare “healthier” distal ferns to more unhealthy ones to get a sense of natural life cycles of ferns from year to year -->Do flourescence values naturally decline over the life cycle of a particular frond? 
   * Differences in cavitation between ferns? 
* 2
   * PS in year 2 is same as year 1, for whole plant, because fronds grow new -- but PS decreases after first growth of an individual frond
   * Tardally deciduous -- fronds eventually die. 
   * Fern in trouble if new croziers don’t form in spring
   * Twisted new fronds = sign of die off? Maybe not. 
* 3
   * Sites on Cougar Mountain: old mine spoil
   * Area colonized by alder, now maple, no conifer
* 4
* 5
   * Odds of survival are 5x higher within 9ft of tree or CWD
* 6
   * Is death gradual or sudden?
   * A couple plots have shown rebound -- have fronds per fern continued to decline in those 2 plots?
* 7
* 8
   * Die off in kitsap -- Indianola
   * Animal trails, probably not purely mechanical cause -- vectors 
   * Animals might just like walking in clear areas
   * Deer, coyote, bear
   * Soil transmission: no discernable results yet




Possible biotic causes:
* Soilborne pathogen
* Vascular wilt pathogen with vector
* Does age/size of fern rhizome mattter?
* Is organism already present as endophyte and stress makes it become pathogenic?
* Can we characterize disease agent organism in water?
* Phytophthera? Root disease eats away in the winter, but symptoms are seen in the summer in drought circumstances
* Separate greenhouses? Maybe vector is aboveground




Illumina sequencing: extracting DNA from plant tissue, use PCR to magnify specific region of DNA, … you could potentially find an OTU associated with sick ferns
